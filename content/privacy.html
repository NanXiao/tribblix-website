<h1>&gt; Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
Tribblix, and its creator Peter Tribble, care about Privacy and Data
Protection.
</p>

<p>
We track IP addresses for media and package downloads. These are only
used for estimates of usage. Package downloads also track the version
of Tribblix in use, again solely for the purpose of aggregate
statistics of version and package usage. If you install or use
Tribblix, no other information is sent to us.
</p>

<p>
Tribblix makes use of other services and the privacy policy associated
with those services also applies.
