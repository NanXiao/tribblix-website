title: base-iso overlay

<h1>Overlay base-iso - Base packages, in the live image</h1>
<p>This is the set of packages that live in the live image as shipped
on the standard ISO. It's designed just for that, and would normally
be extended to at least the @base overlay.</p>
<p>For a server, specifically if you need to connect to a SAN or a
storage fabric, the @base-server overlay is more appropriate.</p>
