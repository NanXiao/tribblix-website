<h1>&gt; Tribblix on AWS</h1>

<p>
AWS - Amazon Web Services - is one place to run Tribblix in the
<a href="cloud.html">cloud.</a>
</p>

<p>
You can run Tribblix on an EC2 instance on AWS.
</p>

<p>
There are AMIs available for both vanilla Tribblix and the LX-enabled
OmniTribblix. These are available in the London (eu-west-2) region. If you
set your region to London, launch an instance, browse AMIs, and then search
Community AMIs for "illumos" or "Tribblix" then you should get some results
like the following:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Specifically, the currently available AMIs are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tribblix m33 - ami-0a72f94422d5adb03</li>
<li>OmniTribblix m33lx - ami-03b6be7aaf3e28171</li>
<li>Tribblix m33 (Nitro) - ami-0655728fa1367a72b</li>
<li>OmniTribblix m33lx (Nitro) - ami-07960c92aeb66f0e1</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tribblix m31 - ami-09b9bb965f8c61549</li>
<li>OmniTribblix m31lx - ami-0618130c66a698e81</li>
<li>Tribblix m31 (Nitro) - ami-0467b145d850dba9f</li>
<li>OmniTribblix m31lx (Nitro) - ami-0ce0a55e6e7d756a2</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want to run Tribblix in a different region, then you'll have to copy
the AMI.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the networking doesn't initialise properly on the first
boot. Rebooting the instance from the AWS console ought to clear that.
</p>

<p>
The images labelled (Nitro) support the new (t3, m5 etc.) instance types.
They won't run on the older (t2, m4, etc.) instances. <b>Do not enable static
networking on a Nitro instance, the system will crash and not come back.</b>
There isn't any difference between the Nitro and non-Nitro images other
than which instance types they will boot on.
</p>

<p>
The m4 and similar generation instances work well for the other images, as do
t2 instances. The t2.micro is just fine for Tribblix, and is on the free tier.
For these, I recommend you do enable static networking with
<code>
zap staticnet -y
</code>
</p>

<p>
After launching an instance, you should be able to log in as root with your
key pair. That's the only way in, there's no jack account, and no valid root
password. You should create your own regular users, of course.
</p>

<p>
If you want to store data, add an EBS volume and create a separate ZFS pool.
(This will also make it easier to move the data to another instance when you
need to.)
</p>

<p>
The images supplied only have a smallish system disk. If you need a bigger
root pool (as opposed to adding a second data pool) then create the root
EBS volume with a larger size and expand the pool with:
</p>
<pre>
# zpool online -e rpool c2t0d0
</pre>
<p>
to get the additional space recognised. You can enlarge an EBS volume after
instance creation, but it will take a reboot for Tribblix to realise that
the volume size has changed.
