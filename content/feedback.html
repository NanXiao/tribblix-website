<h1>&gt; Feedback</h1>

<p>
If you've found a bug or problem in Tribblix, then please get in touch.
</p>

<p>
The simplest and most direct way is to email:
</p>
<br />
<address>tribblix@gmail.com</address>
<br />
<p>
I'll do my best to respond, although I don't offer an SLA.
</p>

<p>
In terms of available packages, that's driven by the <a href="https://github.com/tribblix/build">build repo</a>, so you can see how most of the packages are put together, what build-time options were chosen, and what patches (if any) were applied. The build scripts will sometimes have commentary explaining the choices made. Email is still the best way to ask about a package - I might have tried to add it and had problems, or it's on my pending list.
</p>

<p>
No, I don't have a forum, dedicated bug tracker, or a mailing list. The level of interest hasn't historically been high enough to justify the effort.
