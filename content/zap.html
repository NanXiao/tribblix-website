<h1>&gt; Zip Archive Packaging</h1>

<p>
Tribblix uses traditional Solaris SVR4 packaging, but this is
largely hidden by a layer called ZAP - short for Zip Archive Packaging
- and implemented by a command also called <code>zap</code>.
</p>

<p>
Because of the connection to packaging, zap is also used to manage
<a href="zap-zones.html">zones</a> and perform
system <a href="zap-upgrade.html">upgrades</a>.
</p>

<p>
In ZAP, packages are distributed as zip archives of SVR4 packages in
filesystem format. This means that you don't need any special tools to
access the package contents, and they're compressed for network
distribution.
</p>

<p>
In general, though, Tribblix thinks about managing software suites or
applications, not individual packages - the packages are an
implementation detail that you should be able to ignore most of the
time. The level of abstraction you should normally use are
the <a href="overlays.html">overlays</a>.
</p>

<h2>zap usage</h2>

<p>
To see which overlays are available, and whether they're installed, run:
</p>
<pre>
zap list-overlays
</pre>

<p>
To see a little more detail about a given overlay, run:
</p>
<pre>
zap describe-overlay <i>overlay-name</i>
</pre>

<p>
To install an overlay, as root run:
</p>
<pre>
zap install-overlay <i>overlay-name</i>
</pre>
<p>
Any dependent overlays will automatically be installed.
</p>

<p>
To make the system aware of new and updated packages and overlays,
as root run:
</p>
<pre>
zap refresh
</pre>

<p>
To check that an overlay is correctly installed, run:
</p>
<pre>
zap verify-overlay <i>overlay-name</i>
</pre>
<p>
(if the overlay isn't installed, then it will just say so).
</p>

<p>
To update the packages in an overlay, to handle either updates to
packages or overlays, or if something has got messed up, as root run:
</p>
<pre>
zap update-overlay <i>overlay-name</i>
</pre>
<p>
If you want to update all the installed overlays, it's:
</p>
<pre>
zap update-overlay -a
</pre>

<p>
While the preferred (and strongly recommended) mechanism is to always
work with overlays, zap also supports operating on packages directly,
using the following commands:
</p>
<pre>
zap list-packages
zap describe-package <i>package-name</i>
zap install <i>package-name</i>
zap update <i>package-name</i>
zap uninstall <i>package-name</i>
</pre>
<p>
(note, though, that dependency handling is ignored if you use zap to
manipulate packages directly).
</p>

<h2>Downloads, cache management, and implementation</h2>

<p>
Installing packages requires them to be downloaded from a
repository. Downloaded packages are kept
in <code>/var/zap/cache</code>. If you remove a package, and need to
later install it again, it will use the package in the cache if it
finds it. If you want to install multiple machines and only download
files once, then you can copy the package files
into <code>/var/zap/cache</code> on other systems. If that directory
uses too much space, it's perfectly fine to delete some or all of the
files there.
</p>

<p>
If you use <code>-O</code> to add an overlay when installing a
zone, the downloaded packages are cached in the global zone. Next time
you install a zone with that extra overlay, it won't need to download
the files again.
</p>

<p>
The overlay metadata is stored in the following directory:
</p>
<pre>
/var/sadm/overlays
</pre>
<p>
The <code>ovl</code> files are the overlay metadata,
the <code>pkgs</code> files contain the list of packages. Whether an
overlay is installed or not is simply based on whether a file with the
overlay's name exists in <code>/var/sadm/overlays/installed</code>.
</p>

<p>
The details of repositories and catalogs are stored under
</p>
<pre>
/etc/zap
</pre>
<p>
The <code>list</code> files here list the available repositories and
their preference. The files under <code>/etc/zap/repositories</code>
are the repo details and their catalogs.
</p>
