title: Creating a Package

<h1>&gt; Creating a package</h1>

<p>
Packages in Tribblix come from 3 places:
</p>
<ul>
<li>From illumos, see the scripts in the <a href="https://github.com/tribblix/tribblix-build">tribblix-build</a> repo - specifically <code>repo_all.sh</code></li>
<li>From a legacy distribution, these are temporary (for a rather long-running notion of temporary)</li>
<li>Native Tribblix packages, driven by the <a href="https://github.com/tribblix/build">build repo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Adding additional packages is all about the third option above. This is how I create a package.
</p>

<h3>Naming</h3>

<p>
OK, naming is one of the hardest problems. Tribblix uses SVR4 packaging, so native packages start with the string <code>TRIB</code> (it's not a stock ticker, but I don't have a stock ticker anyway).
</p>

<p>
Standalone packages I tend to simply take the name of the software and put it together with the prefix. So the <code>foo</code> software would be in the <code>TRIBfoo</code> package.
</p>

<p>
There are special names for modules for runtimes, such as perl and python. In the case of perl, the prefix is <code>TRIBlib-perl-5-</code> with the module name added on, dash-separated. In the case of python modules, the bar module would be <code>TRIBbar-python-XX</code>, where XX is the python version. (For python modules, though, there's a <code>pygen</code> script that will do most of the work for you.)
</p>

<p>
Some packages there at the moment have names that look unusual. These tend to be historical - usually there was a prior version of the package (perhaps sourced from elsewhere) and I've kept the package name unchanged to ensure that updates run smoothly.
</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>
Once you have a package name, then create a directory with that name in the build repo and start to populate it. There are a number of files you may need to create.

<dl>

<dt>alias</dt>
<dd>The alias file is a list of other names this package is known by. This is the friendly name - so that a user can type <code>zap install foo</code>. If it's unlikely that the package will never be added manually (and remember that the intention is that overlays are the primary form of software management) then you don't need an alias. Sometimes you'll have different versions of a package, in which case there will be an alias with the version number, and an unversioned alias for the default or preferred version. (In that case, try and make sure that the default alias matches up with the version that would be installed via any overlays).</dd>

<dt>depend</dt>
<dd>This file is an SVR4 depend file, so it's a list of other packages this package depends on at runtime, one to a line, with a leading <code>P</code> to show it's a prerequisite. Package construction will attempt to divine runtime dependencies from shared objects, but that isn't always reliable. But if the package build tells you the actual dependencies differ from what was expected, it's time to take a closer look.</dd>

<dt>build_require/build_incompatible</dt>
<dd>These files detail build-time dependencies. Because they don't end up in the package, they're simple lists of package names. The <code>depinstalled</code> script checks against these, and more tooling ought to.</dd>

<dt>pkginfo</dt>
<dd>This is the key fragment of an SVR4 pkginfo file. It <b>must</b> contain entries for PKG, NAME, and VERSION. If possible, it ought to contain a ZAP_URL entry, which is where the package comes from.</dd>

<dt>pkginfo.arch/arch.txt</dt>
<dd>Normally, when you build a package it will embed the architecture of the build host into the package. If you want to build one package that will install on multiple architectures (for example, groovy is cross-platform), list the architectures in <code>pkginfo.arch</code>. If you know the package won't ever work on multiple architectures (for example, go isn't supported on sparc) then put the working architecture in <code>arch.txt</code> - this won't affect the build, but there are tools that look to see whether a package ought to be built or not.</dd>

<dt>build.sh</dt>
<dd>This is the main build script. Sometimes it really is a shell script, but it's also a simple record of the commands you would type. There are standard forms for the most common types of build.</dd>

<dt>fixinstall</dt>
<dd>This is run after install, in the source directory. So if a simple <code>make install</code> doesn't quite work, you can fix it up here.</dd>

<dt>fixit</dt>
<dd>This is a script run after install, in the temporary install directory. This is where you can delete any things that shouldn't be present, or move things around if they got put in the wrong place. There are a standard set of fixit rules for common issues (for example, we don't ship info files or static libraries by default).</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Canned helpers</h3>

<p>
There are a number of canned helper scripts.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>dobuild</dt>
<dd>This is the master script. It assumes the common configure/make/install workflow, and has a fair few options. See below for more details.</dd>

<dt>cmbuild</dt>
<dd>This is a variant of dobuild for software that uses CMake.</dd>

<dt>mesonbuild</dt>
<dd>This is a variant of dobuild for software that uses meson.</dd>

<dt>unpack</dt>
<dd>A convenient way to unpack a source tarball; it understands a variety of compression schemes and archive formats.</dd>

<dt>genpkg</dt>
<dd>Having built the software, this script will install it to a temporary location and built a package. It's the partner to dobuild.</dd>

<dt>create_pkg</dt>
<dd>This is a subset of genpkg, that assumes you've created a simple staging area yourself (if, for instance, a vanilla <code>make install</code> doesn't do the right thing).</dd>

<dt>pkg_tarball</dt>
<dd>In some cases, all you want is a source tarball converted into an installable package. This is a script to do just that.</dd>

</dl>
