<h1>&gt; Desktop Usage Notes</h1>

<h2>GStreamer</h2>

<p>If you see warnings or errors about GStreamer being unable to load
its plugins, delete the registry file(s) in $HOME/.cache/gstreamer-1.0.</p>

<h2>Sakura</h2>

<p>The Sakura terminal is probably the best all-round terminal. To change
settings, start up one copy, right-click to get into the settings menu. Once
you have it the way you want, close that instance of Sakura to save the
settings.</p>

<h2>Xfce</h2>

<p>You can add the Whisker Menu by right-click on a panel, got to Panel,
Add New Items.</p>

<p>The background wallpaper is under Desktop Settings. (Just right-click on the
background.)</p>

<p>If you want transparency, and you're lucky enough that your combination
of graphics card and Tribblix manages to support it, go to Window Manager
Tweaks and it's under the right-most tab, Compositor.</p>
