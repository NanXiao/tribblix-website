<h1>&gt; Tribblix Upgrades</h1>

<p>
There are two paths to get newer versions of software in Tribblix,
both using the <a href="zap.html">zap</a> utility. An <em>update</em>
will install newer versions of packages or overlays, while
an <em>upgrade</em> will install a newer version of Tribblix.
</p>

<p>
In general, updates affect the current system and can be applied with
the system running. You'll have to restart any application you've
updated. Whereas an upgrade creates a new boot environment, installs
new packages to that, and you reboot to activate the upgraded system.
</p>

<p>
Before doing an upgrade, you <b>must</b> ensure that the system has the
latest versions of the appropriate software. As root, issue:
</p>
<pre>
zap refresh
</pre>
<p>
followed by
</p>
<pre>
zap update TRIBzap-upgrade
</pre>

<p>
You will then be able to check whether an upgrade is available:
</p>
<pre>
zap upgrade list
</pre>
<p>
and you should be given a list similar to the following:
</p>
<pre>
m30: (current)
m31: Milestone 31
</pre>
<p>
which shows that you're currently running the m30 release, and that an
upgrade to m31 (Milestone 31) is available.
</p>

<p>
To perform the upgrade:
</p>
<pre>
zap upgrade m31
</pre>
<p>
and then to boot into the newly upgraded system, use beadm to activate
it and then reboot - the appropriate commands will be printed at the
end of the upgrade process, but will be something like
</p>
<pre>
beadm activate m31
init 6
</pre>

<p>
If the newly upgraded system fails to work properly, then you can roll
back to the previous version. If you're in a running system then you
can use <code>beadm list</code> to see the available boot environments
</p>
<pre>
BE       Active Mountpoint      Space Policy Created
m30      -      -               28.0M static 2023-05-03 15:40
m31      NR     /               12.2G static 2023-07-10 18:42
</pre>
<p>
(note that the initially installed boot environment will usually be
called tribblix), and then
</p>
<pre>
beadm activate m30
init 6
</pre>
<p>
to go back to the older boot environment.
</p>

<p>
If the new boot environment won't boot properly, simply select the old
one from the boot menu, and then <code>beadm activate</code> it so it
will be the default next time.
</p>

<p>
If you have the ISO for the new release, then you might save some time
and bandwidth by copying the zap files from the pkgs directory on the
ISO into the <code>/var/zap/cache</code> directory. And if you're
upgrading more than one system, copying <code>/var/zap/cache</code>
will do even better.
</p>

<p>
Once you're happy that the new version of Tribblix is working well,
you can remove older versions with the <code>beadm destroy</code>
command.
