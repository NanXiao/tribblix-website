<h1>&gt; First Use</h1>

<p>
The live environment you get when booted from the ISO image
is a little sparse, by design. You can check
that Tribblix will boot on your system, and check that it can see the
devices that you expect (run <code>format</code> to see what disks are
detected, and <code>/usr/sbin/dladm show-phys</code> to list network
interfaces). And then do an <a href="install.html">install</a>, adding
the <a href="overlays.html">overlays</a> you find interesting. A
reasonable starting point would be to add <code>develop xfce</code> and
possibly <code>xfce-extras</code>, or just install
the <code>kitchen-sink</code>. You can add additional software
overlays later using <a href="zap.html">zap</a>.
</p>

<p>Log in as jack, and you can get a very ancient desktop (twm) using
<code>startx</code>.</p>

<p>To get Xfce, run <code>startxfce4</code>. (If you create a new
account, you may find that you have trouble saving Xfce settings; if
that's the case simply copy the <code>.config</code> directory from
<code>/jack</code> and this should set everything up.)</p>

<p>For other desktops, there's a <code>setxsession</code> command that
allows you to choose which desktop to run. Without arguments, it will
just list which desktop environments/window managers it knows about,
and whether they're installed. Just choose one, for example:
</p>
<pre>
setxsession wmaker
</pre>
<p>and then run startx to get it running.
</p>
